    <h1>BASIC GIT COMMANDS</h1>
    <h2><u>git init</u></h2>
    <p>~ when you run this command in your project directory, or 
        when you cloned an existing project, you created a 
        repository
        The repository is a subdirectory named .git containing various 
        files
        The dot indicates a “hidden” directory
        You do not work directly with the contents of that directory; 
        various git commands do that for you
    </p>
